# Theatre_Explorer

Theatre Explorer provides a CLI for users to interact with production information from the website www.broadwayworld.com.  The user experience begins with selecting whether to search for productions by name or by year.  After that selection, specific aspects of a chosen production can be viewed in greater detail.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Theatre_Explorer'
```
To use this gem, type the following command into your terminal:

    $ gem install Theatre_Explore

Once the gem has been added to your system, use the command `Explore!` to initiate the user interface.

## Usage

After running the interface by entering the command `Explore!`, simply follow the prompts and enter the appropriate information for your search.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
